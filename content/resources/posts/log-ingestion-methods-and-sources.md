<h1><strong>Understanding Log Ingestion and Sources</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>Introduction:</strong></h2>

<p>
Every action you take online in your organization leaves a trail. Log ingestion records and processes and preserve those trails for valuable insights. It's such a behind-the-scenes activity that really keeps systems functioning smoothly, flags security breaches, and verifies regulatory compliance. Let's now uncover the dynamics of log ingestion from log collectors to cloud-based APIs.
</p>
<h2><strong>Why Log Ingestion is Important</strong></h2>

<p>

![Why Log Ingestion is Important](/img/resources/log-ingestion-image2.jpg "Why Log Ingestion is Important")

</p>
<p>
Effective log ingestion enables an organization to:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Monitor Systems: Analyze logs and maintain a view of overall system health and performance.

<li>Troubleshoot Issues: Utilize detailed log data to identify and resolve issues promptly.

<li>Ensure Security: Security logs alert on unauthorized access and potential security threats.

<li>Compliance: Many regulations require log data for reporting and/or audit purposes to prove a record of system activity for any given timeframe.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Now that we know why log ingestion is crucial, let's examine the different methods for achieving it.
</p>
<h2><strong>Log Ingestion Methods</strong></h2>

<p>
There are various methods and tools available to ingest logs effectively:
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>Use of Log Collectors and Servers</strong>
</ul>
<p>
Log collectors are tools that gather logs from various sources and then send them to a central log server or storage. Some log collectors can analyze and standardize these logs before sending them, making the collection easier and ready for central log storage.
</p>
</ul>

<li><strong>Direct Ingestion Through REST APIs</strong>
</ul>
<p>
Applications that support this method can ingest logs directly to central log storage using REST APIs. This option is interesting for high-volume log-generating applications that need to be analyzed in real-time.
</p>
</ul>

<li><strong>Utilizing Cloud Services for Log Collection</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Major cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and <a href="https://discuss.openobserve.ai/t/trouble-running-openobserve-with-docker-and-gcs-storage/2K6351">Google Cloud</a> have their own log collectors that are usually designed to scale easily and handle petabytes of logs. These cloud-based collectors offer interesting solutions for collecting and storing logs.
</p>
</ul>

<li><strong>Application and Technology-Specific Log Forwarding</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A lot of applications and technologies have the possibility to natively forward logs. Web servers, for example, can be configured to forward logs to an endpoint where they can be ingested. This is the case for Apache, Nginx, and many more.
</p>
</ol><h2><strong>Sources of Log Data</strong></h2>

<p>

![](/img/resources/log-ingestion-image3.png)

</p>
<p>
Log data can come from any or all of the components in your IT stack:
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>Network Devices and Syslog</strong>

</ul>
<p>

</p>


<li><strong>Operating Systems: Windows, Linux, and VMware</strong>

</ul>
<p>
Your operating systems produce log data that details information about the system events, user activity, and performance. This data is helpful for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.
</p>


<li><strong>Cloud Services: AWS, Azure, and GCP</strong>
</ull>
<p>
Your cloud providers create a massive amount of logs for all the activities that happen in the cloud environments. These logs aid in <a href="https://openobserve.ai/blog/observability-platforms">monitoring cloud resources</a>, anomalous activities, and compliance.
</p>


<li><strong>Containers and Kubernetes</strong>

</ul>
<p>
Your containers and container orchestration tools like Kubernetes produce log data that aids in monitoring the health and performance of containerized apps.
</p>


<li><strong>Application and Web Server Logs</strong>

</ul>
<p>
Your applications and web servers produce logs in great detail. They include information about user activities, errors, and performance.
</p>


<li><strong>Custom Log Sources and API-Based Logs</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can configure your custom applications to produce logs and use APIs to ingest such logs for custom log monitoring.
</p>
<p>
With all these log sources in mind, let's explore the key components and tools that can help you manage them.
</p>
</ol><h2><strong>Key Components and Tools for Log Ingestion</strong></h2>

<p>
So, how does one go about ingesting logs in a scalable manner? There are a few components and tools that help with this task:
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>Log Collectors and Aggregators</strong>

</ul>
<p>
Collect logs from various sources, ensure proper formatting, and forward them to the next destination.
</p>


<li><strong>Configuration of Data Collection Rules (DCRs)</strong>

</ul>
<p>
Control what data to collect and how to handle it, preventing unnecessary logs from being ingested.
</p>


<li><strong>Client Libraries for Various Programming Languages</strong>

</ul>
<p>
Client libraries ease the log ingestion workload from developers and allow them to add logging capabilities easily into their code.
</p>


<li><strong>HTTP Data Collector API</strong>

</ul>
<p>
Ingests log data directly via HTTP. This provides flexibility to address various logging scenarios.
</p>


<li><strong>Log Analytics Workspace and Custom Tables</strong>

</ul>
<p>
They offer a container and a schema to store log data and support queries on the stored log data.
</p>
</ol><h2><strong>Log Ingestion APIs</strong></h2>

<p>
One example of a robust log ingestion API is Azure Monitor's Logs Ingestion API. Here's an overview of how it works:
