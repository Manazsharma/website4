`ZincObserve` is a cloud native observability platform (Logs, Metrics, Traces) that provides ~140x (YMMV. Could be higher or lower based on data entropy) lower storage costs (compared to Elasticsearch) for real life log data, significantly lower operational cost and ease of use. It can scale to petabytes of data, is highly performant and allows you to sleep better at night ðŸ˜€. If you are looking for an observability tool for logs, metrics and traces do evaluate ZincObserve and how its approach towards observability could help you build better software, save money on observability costs, and sleep better.
