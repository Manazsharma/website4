## Limitations and Challenges With Prometheus and Grafana


### Prometheus:

When it comes to Prometheus, one of the biggest challenges is its configuration complexity.

Setting up Prometheus can be a bit challenging.

You need to define your scrape configs, set up your alerting rules, and configure your storage backend. It's not exactly a walk in the park, especially if you're new to the tool.

Another issue with Prometheus is long-term data storage. By default, Prometheus stores data locally on disk, which can be great for short-term analysis but not so much for long-term trending.

As your metrics grow over time, you might find yourself running out of disk space faster than you can say "time-series data." A work around this is using remote storage backends like Thanos or Cortex. But that adds another layer of complexity to your setup.


### Grafana:

Grafana, on the other hand, has its own set of limitations. One of the biggest is its dependency on external data sources.

This means you need to have your data stored somewhere else, like Prometheus or Elasticsearch, and then connect Grafana to it. It's not a huge deal, but it does add an extra step to your setup along with the need for an additional system.

Another challenge with Grafana is its limited data processing capabilities. While Grafana is great for visualizing data, it's not so great at transforming or changing it.

If you need to do complex data processing, you'll likely need to do it in your data source before bringing it into Grafana. This can be a bit of a hassle, especially if you're dealing with large amounts of data.
