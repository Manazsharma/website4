        "question": "What are yu folks building?",
        "answer": "We are building the easiest, most efficient and sophisticated observability tool to monitor all your applications and infrastructure. You get a unified view of logs, metrics and traces and ability to easily navigate and correlate them. We are building a tool that is easy to operate, has great UX, and that you can start with mega bytes of data and scale to peta bytes of data. You can run this tool using a single binary on your laptop with less than 100 MB RAM.",

        "open": true
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I ingest Amazon cloudwatch logs into ZincObserve?",
        "answer": "You can ingest amazon cloudwatch logs into ZincObserve by subscribing a cloudwatch log-group to a kinesis firehose stream. You can then use HTTP delivery of kinesis firehose to send any logs to ZincObserve.",

      },
      {
        "question": "Where does ZincObserve store data?",
        "answer": "ZincObserve can store data on local disk or s3 when run in a single node mode. In HA mode ZincObserve requires an object store to store data. You could use s3, GCS, minio,  Azure blob and any other s3 compatible object store. ZincObserve stores its metadata in sled for single node installation and in etcd for HA installation.",
        "open": true
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I build dashboards in ZincObserve?",
        "answer": "Yes, You can build dashboards in ZincObserve. For Logs and traces data you can use SQL like queries to build dashboards. For metrics data you can use both PromQL and SQL to build dashboards. You can have data from logs, metrics and traces in the same dashboard giving you a unified view of all data.",
        "open": false
      },
      {
        "question": "Can ZincObserve send alerts?",
        "answer": "Yes, ou can send alerts to many sources like slack, teams, prometheus alertmanager and more.. ZincObserve can send alerts to various destinations using its highly configurable destination builder. You can configure alerts using SQL like queries for logs and traces data and PromQL for metrics data.",

      },
      {
        "question": "What are ingest functions?",
        "answer": "Ingest functions in ZincObserve are created using VRL a javascript like language. Ingest functions can be used to parse, filter, transform and enrich data at the time of ingestion. You can use ingest functions to parse logs, extract metrics from logs, filter logs, transform logs and more. Ingest functions run on the incoming data before it is stored in ZincObserve",
        "open": false
      },
      {
        "question": "What are query functions?",
        "answer": "Query functions in ZincObserve are created using VRL a javascript like language. Query functions can be used to parse, filter, transform and enrich data.

        "question": "How does ZincObserve compare to Elasticsearch?",
        "answer": "ZincObserve can have 140x lower storage cost compared to Elasticsearch and much lower operational burden to maintain. Due to stateless nodes ZincObserve can scale much faster than Elasticsearch. ZincObserve has been written in rust and enjoys its high performance and low memory footprint. ZincObserve is also much easier to operate than Elasticsearch. ZincObserve has been built specifically for observability use cases while Elasticsearch was built as a text search engine being used for observability use cases.",
