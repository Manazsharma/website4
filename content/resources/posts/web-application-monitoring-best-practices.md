<p>
A well-performing web application depends on several critical metrics, known as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These metrics provide valuable insights for optimizing customer experience and operational efficiency.
</p>
<h4><strong>Uptime</strong></h4>

<p>
Uptime refers to the percentage of time a web application remains accessible to users. The more open it is (high uptime), the better it is for users who can always access it. 
</p>
<h4><strong>Response Time</strong></h4>

<p>
Response time measures a customer request and the corresponding application response. Response time is how long it takes for the application to answer you.  
</p>
<h4><strong>Error Rates</strong></h4>

<p>
Error rates quantify the frequency of errors encountered by customers during application interaction. They track how often your customers see error messages or experience crashes.
</p>
<h4><strong>CPU Utilization</strong></h4>

<p>
CPU utilization measures the percentage of Central Processing Unit (CPU) resources consumed by the web application to process requests and execute tasks. Your application is like a computer with a brain (CPU). CPU utilization tracks how busy the brain is handling user requests. 
</p>
<p>
You can proactively manage and optimize your web applications by diligently monitoring these KPIs - uptime, response time, error rates, and CPU utilization.
</p>
<p>
This way, customers have a frustration-free experience.
</p>
<h4><strong>Benefits of Tracking Performance Metrics</strong></h4>

<p>
<strong>Happy Users</strong>: By keeping application response times fast and errors low, customers have a smooth experience and are likelier to return.
