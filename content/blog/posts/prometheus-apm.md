**Setting Up Docker Containers**

1. Install Docker: First, make sure Docker is installed on your system. You can find comprehensive installation guides on Docker's official website.
2. Create a Docker Network: This network will enable communication between the Prometheus and OpenObserve containers.

```
docker network create monitoring-net
```

### Configuring Prometheus in Agent Mode

**Creating the Prometheus Configuration File**

Configure your prometheus.yml file, which is essential for setting up Prometheus. Here, you'll define the rules and targets for scraping metrics.

```
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s  # How often Prometheus scrapes metrics

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']  # Adjust this to include your specific targets
```

**Deploying Prometheus with Docker**

```
docker pull prom/prometheus
docker run --name prometheus -d -p 9090:9090 --network monitoring-net -v $(pwd)/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus
```

**Configuring Scrape Jobs**

Define various jobs in your prometheus.yml to scrape metrics from different assets or services. Specify the targets and the interval for each job.

```
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'example-service'
    scrape_interval: 10s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['service_hostname:port']
```

### Integrating OpenObserve with Prometheus

**Setting Up OpenObserve**

Pull the OpenObserve Docker image and run the container within your Docker network.

```
docker pull openobserve/openobserve
docker run --name openobserve -d -p 5080:5080 --network monitoring-net openobserve/openobserve
```

### Configuring OpenObserve

1. Access OpenObserve: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5080. The interface is straightforward, eliminating the need for complex setups.
2. Configure prometheus remote write to send data to OpenObserve. You can find the prometheus remote write configuration under Ingestion> Metrics>Prometheus menu.

   * Once you do this prometheus will start sending metrics using remote write to OpenObserve.
   * You should run prometheus in agent mode to keep prometheus resource requirements low. Check this blog for more information – https://prometheus.io/blog/2021/11/16/agent/
   * You can use standard PromQL queries to build dashboards in OpenObserve. You could also resort to drag and drop functionality for building dashboards without writing queries manually.
