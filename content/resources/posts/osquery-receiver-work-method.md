<h2>How Osquery Works</h2>

<p>
Osquery is an open-source tool that provides detailed visibility into device states by allowing users to query machine states using SQL-like queries. It operates in two modes: osqueryi for ad-hoc queries and osqueryd for scheduling periodic background queries. Here is a detailed explanation of how Osquery works:
</p>
<h3>Basic SQL Commands</h3>

<p>
Osquery uses basic SQL commands to interact with the underlying system as a relational database. This allows users to query machine states in a structured and efficient manner. SQL commands extract specific information from the system, such as logs, processes, and network connections.
</p>
<h3>Modes of Operation</h3>

<p>
Osquery operates in two main modes:
</p>
<ol>

<li>osqueryi: This is the interactive query console/shell. It is a standalone console that does not communicate with a daemon and does not require running as an administrator (although some tables may return fewer results when running as non-administrator). Users can prototype queries and explore the current state of their operating system using osqueryi.


<li>osqueryd: This is a long-lived daemon that executes repeated, periodic queries in the background. It is designed to run continuously and can be configured to execute specific queries at set intervals. osqueryd requires root or system privileges to gather detailed information.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Agent Software</h3>

<p>
Osquery employs agent software that needs root or system privileges to gather detailed information. This agent software collects data from the system and stores it in a format that can be queried using SQL commands. The agent software is designed to be lightweight and efficient, allowing it to run on a wide range of platforms without significant resource usage.
