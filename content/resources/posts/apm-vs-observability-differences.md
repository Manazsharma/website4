</p>
<h3>Key Aspects Covered by APM</h3>

<p>
APM covers several critical aspects, including:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Latency</strong>: Measures the time it takes for a request to travel from the user to the server and back. Lower latency means a faster response time.

<li><strong>Traffic</strong>: Monitors the amount of data being transferred between the application and its users. This helps in understanding usage patterns and potential bottlenecks.

<li><strong>Errors</strong>: Tracks the number and types of errors occurring in the application. This is crucial for identifying and fixing bugs.

<li><strong>Saturation</strong>: Indicates how much of the application's resources are being used. High saturation levels can lead to performance degradation.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples and Use Cases of APM Tools</h3>

<h2>What is Observability?


![What is Observability?](/img/resources/apm-vs-observability-image2.png "What is Observability?")


</h2>

<p>
Observability is the practice of instrumenting your systems so you can infer their internal state from the outputs they generate, such as logs, metrics, and traces. This approach allows you to gain a detailed understanding of how your systems behave, identify issues quickly, and address them effectively.
</p>
<h3>Importance of Context Within Telemetry Data</h3>

<p>
Telemetry data provides the raw information needed to understand what is happening inside your systems. However, without context, this data can be meaningless. Observability emphasizes the importance of context, allowing you to correlate different pieces of data to form a complete picture of system behavior. This context helps in pinpointing the root cause of issues and understanding their impact.
</p>
<h3>Three Pillars of Observability: Logs, Metrics, and Traces</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Logs</strong>: Logs are records of events that have occurred within your system. They provide a detailed, time-stamped account of actions and errors, making them invaluable for troubleshooting and forensic analysis.

<li><strong>Metrics</strong>: Metrics are numerical data points that represent the performance and health of your system. They include measurements like CPU usage, memory consumption, and request rates. Metrics help in identifying trends and alerting you to potential issues.

<li><strong>Traces</strong>: Traces follow the journey of a request through your system, showing how different components interact. They provide a detailed view of the request flow, helping you understand performance bottlenecks and dependencies.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Comparing APM and Observability</h2>

<p>
Understanding the differences between Application Performance Monitoring (APM) and Observability is crucial for choosing the right approach to maintain and improve your systems. While both are essential, they serve different purposes and offer unique benefits.
</p>
<h3>Differences in Data Collection, Scope, and Alerting</h3>

<p>
<strong>Data Collection</strong>:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>APM</strong>: Primarily collects metrics related to application performance, such as response times, error rates, and throughput. It focuses on predefined data points.

<li><strong>Observability</strong>: Collects a broader range of telemetry data, including logs, metrics, and traces. This comprehensive data collection provides deeper insights into system behavior.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Scope</strong>:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>APM</strong>: Concentrates on monitoring the performance of specific applications and their components. It helps in identifying performance issues within a defined scope.

<li><strong>Observability</strong>: Encompasses the entire system, offering a holistic view of all components and their interactions. It provides context and correlation across different data types and sources.
