![Advanced Console Methods and Practical Examples](/img/resources/javascript-logging-image2.png "Advanced Console Methods and Practical Examples")

</p>
<p>
Here is a detail of the advanced console methods and practical examples:
</p>
<h3><strong>Demonstrating Code Execution Timing, Message Grouping, and Error Handling</strong></h3>

<h4><strong>Measuring Code Execution Time:</strong></h4>

<p>
javascript
</p>
<p>
console.time('myTimer');
</p>
<p>
// Some complex code here
</p>
<p>
console.timeEnd('myTimer');
</p>
<p>
The console.time() and console.timeEnd() methods allow you to measure the time taken for a block of code to execute. The label passed to both methods must match.
</p>
<h4><strong>Grouping Console Messages:</strong></h4>

<p>
javascript
</p>
<p>
console.group('User Actions');
</p>
<p>
console.log('User clicked button');
</p>
<p>
console.groupCollapsed('Detailed Info');
</p>
<p>
console.log('Button coordinates: x=100, y=200');
</p>
<p>
console.groupEnd();
</p>
<p>
console.groupEnd();
</p>
<p>
The console.group() and console.groupEnd() methods let you group related log messages together, creating a collapsible section in the console. 
</p>
<p>
console.groupCollapsed() starts a group in a collapsed state.
</p>
<h4><strong>Handling Errors with try...catch:</strong></h4>

<p>
javascript
</p>
<p>
try {
</p>
<p>
  // Some code that might throw an error
</p>
<p>
  throw new Error('Something went wrong');
</p>
<p>
} catch (error) {
</p>
<p>
  console.error('Error occurred:', error);
</p>
<p>
} finally {
</p>
<p>
  console.log('Cleanup code executed');
</p>
<p>
}
</p>
<p>
The try...catch...finally syntax allows you to handle exceptions and errors, log the error message using console.error(), and execute cleanup code in the finally block.
</p>
<h3><strong>Using console.table() for Visual Representation of Complex Data</strong></h3>

<p>
javascript
</p>
<p>
const users = [
</p>
<p>
  { name: 'John Doe', age: 32, email: 'john@example.com' },
</p>
<p>
  { name: 'Jane Smith', age: 28, email: 'jane@example.com' },
</p>
<p>
  { name: 'Bob Johnson', age: 45, email: 'bob@example.com' },
</p>
<p>
];
</p>
<p>
console.table(users);
</p>
<p>
The console.table() method displays the provided data (an array or object) in a tabular format, making it easier to visualize and inspect complex data structures.
</p>
<h3><strong>Real-Time Debugging with Pinned Expressions and Stack Tracing</strong></h3>

<p>
Pinning Expressions:
</p>
<p>
javascript
</p>
<p>
let count = 0;
</p>
<p>
console.log('Count:', count);
</p>
<p>
console.log('Count:', ++count);
</p>
<p>
console.log('Count:', count);
</p>
<p>
You can pin expressions in the console by right-clicking on the log and selecting "Expand all" or "Expand recursively". 
</p>
<p>
This allows you to monitor the value of the count variable in real time as it changes.
</p>
<p>
Stack Tracing with console.trace():
</p>
<p>
javascript
</p>
<p>
function a() {
</p>
<p>
  b();
</p>
<p>
}
</p>
<p>
function b() {
</p>
<p>
  c();
</p>
<p>
}
</p>
<p>
function c() {
</p>
<p>
  console.trace('This is the trace');
</p>
<p>
}
</p>
<p>
a();
</p>
<p>
The console.trace() method outputs a stack trace to the console, helping you understand the call stack and the sequence of function invocations that led to the current point in the code.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3><strong>Preserving Console Logs and Clearing the Console</strong></h3>

<h4><strong>Preserving Console Logs:</strong></h4>

<p>
javascript
</p>
<p>
localStorage.setItem('consoleLog', console.log.bind(console));
</p>
<p>
// Later, you can retrieve and use the stored log function:
</p>
<p>
const storedLog = localStorage.getItem('consoleLog');
</p>
<p>
storedLog('This message will be preserved across page navigations');
</p>
<p>
By storing the console.log() function in the browser's localStorage, you can preserve log messages across page navigations and reuse the stored log function later.
</p>
<h4><strong>Clearing the Console:</strong></h4>

<p>
javascript
</p>
<p>
console.clear();
</p>
<p>
The console.clear() method clears the console, removing all previous log messages. In some browsers, it may also display a "Console was cleared" message.
</p>
<p>
These advanced console methods and practical examples demonstrate how you can leverage the power of the JavaScript console to enhance your debugging and development workflow.
</p>
<p>
By mastering these techniques, you can improve code quality, optimize performance, and streamline the debugging process.
