<h2><strong>Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</strong></h2>

<p>
Implementing observability dashboards can be tricky, but don't worry - we've got your back. Here are some common pitfalls and how to steer clear of them:
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>Lack of Clear Objectives</strong>: 
<ul>
 
<li>Define specific goals and KPIs for your dashboards
 
<li>Align dashboard design with business requirements and user needs

</ul>

<p>
Make sure to create dashboards for the sake of creating them. Take the time to understand what you want to achieve and who will use them. It's like planning a road trip—you need to know your destination and who's coming along.<br>
</p>

<li><strong>Overloading Dashboards with Metrics</strong>: 
<ul>
 
<li>Focus on the most critical metrics for each dashboard
 
<li>Use progressive disclosure techniques to manage information overload

</ul>

<p>
It's tempting to cram every metric under the sun into your dashboards, but resist the urge! Too much information can be overwhelming and counterproductive. Stick to the metrics that matter most and use progressive disclosure techniques to reveal additional details when needed.<br>
</p>

<li><strong>Neglecting User Experience</strong>: 
<ul>
 
<li>Design dashboards with usability and readability in mind
 
<li>Ensure consistent layout, color schemes, and navigation

</ul>

<p>
<br>Your dashboards are not just for you - they're for your entire team. Make sure they're easy to use and understand. Stick to a consistent layout, color scheme, and navigation to ensure a seamless user experience.<br>

</p></ol>
<h2><strong>Architecting Observability Dashboards: A Technical Deep Dive</strong></h2>

<p>
Let's roll up our sleeves for a technical deep dive into architecting your observability dashboards. We'll walk through the steps of implementing observability dashboards, complete with code snippets and visual aids. Get ready to dive in!
</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Set Up the Infrastructure</strong></h3>

<p>
First things first - you need to lay the foundation. Here's how to set up the necessary infrastructure components for your observability dashboards:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Dashboard Proxy Service

<li>Prometheus Export Service

<li>Grafana Service
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can use containerization technologies like Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to streamline the deployment process. Here's an example of a docker-compose.yml file that defines the services:
</p>
<p>

![Set Up the Infrastructure](/img/resources/observability-dashboards-image6.png "Set Up the Infrastructure")

<br>
</p>
<p>
This configuration file defines the Dashboard Proxy Service, Prometheus, and Grafana as separate services. It specifies each service's necessary image, port mappings, environment variables, and volume mounts.<br>
</p>
<p>
First things first - you need to lay the foundation. Follow the steps in the<a href="https://openobserve.ai/docs/quickstart/"> OpenObserve Quickstart Guide</a> to set up the necessary infrastructure components for your observability dashboards.
</p>
<p>
You would need ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL and ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD environment variables when you start OpenObserve for the first time. You don't need them on subsequent runs of OpenObserve.
</p>
<p>
Binaries can be downloaded from the<a href="https://github.com/openobserve/openobserve/releases"> releases</a> page for the appropriate platform.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">set ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL=root@example.com
set ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD=Complexpass#123
openobserve.exe</pre>

<p>
Now point your browser to<a href="http://localhost:5080/"> http://localhost:5080</a> and login.
</p>
<p>
For OpenObserve Cloud, navigate to<a href="https://cloud.openobserve.ai/"> https://cloud.openobserve.ai</a>, use a social login or create an account using email / password.
</p>
<p>
Now head over to Ingestion section and grab CURL command.
</p>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Load Sample Data</strong></h3>

<p>
We will use JSON API to load sample log data.
</p>
<p>
Below commands will download a sample file of real life log data, unzip it and load it in OpenObserve using the JSON ingestion API.
</p>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Configure Prometheus</strong></h3>

<p>
Next, you must configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your applications and infrastructure components. Create a prometheus.yml file that defines the scrape targets and intervals. Here's an example:<br><br>

![Configure Prometheus](/img/resources/observability-dashboards-image7.png "Configure Prometheus")

</p>
<p>
In this example, Prometheus is configured to scrape metrics from two targets: an application on port 8080 and an infrastructure component on port 9100. The scrape_interval is set to 15 seconds, determining how frequently Prometheus will collect metrics.
</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Set Up Log Collection and Storage</strong></h3>

<p>
To collect and store log data, you can use tools like Fluentd or Logstash. These tools allow you to ingest log data from various sources and store it in a centralized location, such as Elasticsearch or Couchbase.
</p>
<p>
Here's an example of a Fluentd configuration file (fluent.conf) that collects logs from a file and sends them to OpenObserve:
</p>
<p>

![Set Up Log Collection and Storage](/img/resources/observability-dashboards-image4.png "Set Up Log Collection and Storage")

</p>
<p>
For time-series metrics management, databases like Couchbase provide high performance and scalability. By integrating Couchbase into your observability architecture, you can efficiently store and query large volumes of metrics data.
</p>
<h3><strong>Step 4: Load Sample Data</strong></h3>

<p>
We will use JSON API to load sample log data.
</p>
<p>
Below commands will download a sample file of real life log data, unzip it and load it in OpenObserve using the JSON ingestion API.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Download sample data</strong>
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">curl -L https://zinc-public-data.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/zinc-enl/sample-k8s-logs/k8slog_json.json.zip -o k8slog_json.json.zip
unzip k8slog_json.json.zip</pre>

<p>
<strong>Load sample data</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>Note</em>: Replace the URL you got from OpenObserve Cloud and append it with @k8slog_json.json
</p>
<p>
For OpenObserve Cloud:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">curl -u user@domain.com:abqlg4b673465w46hR2905 -k https://api.openobserve.ai/api/User_organization_435345/default/\_json -d "@k8slog_json.json"</pre>

<p>
For self hosted installation:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">curl http://localhost:5080/api/default/default/\_json -i -u "root@example.com:Complexpass#123" -d "@k8slog_json.json"</pre>

<h3><strong>Step 5: Search for Data</strong></h3>

<p>
Point your browser to<a href="http://cloud.openobserve.ai/"> http://cloud.openobserve.ai</a> (for OpenObserve Cloud) /<a href="http://localhost:5080/"> http://localhost:5080</a> (for self hosted) and login
</p>
<ol>

<li>Visit logs page

<li>Select the index default from drop down in the left

<li>Type <code>match_all('error')</code> in search bar and click the search button on right.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Click on the "syntax guide" button next to the search bar to see examples on how to search.
</p>
<h3><strong>Step 6: Configure OpenObserve Collector</strong></h3>

<p>
Next, you must configure the OpenObserve Collector to scrape metrics, logs, and traces from your applications and infrastructure components. Follow the steps in the<a href="https://github.com/openobserve/openobserve-helm-chart/tree/main/charts/openobserve-collector"> OpenObserve Collector Configuration Guide</a> to set up the collection of logs, metrics, and traces in a Kubernetes cluster.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Prerequisites</strong>
</p>
<ul>

<li>cert-manager: You can install cert-manager using the following command:

<pre class="prettyprint">kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.1/cert-manager.yaml</pre>

<ul>

<li>OpenTelemetry operator: You can install OpenTelemetry operator using the following command:

<pre class="prettyprint">kubectl apply -f https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-operator.yaml
</pre>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Official documentation can be found at <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/operator/">https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/operator/</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Installing the Chart</strong>
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">kubectl create ns openobserve-collector
helm --namespace openobserve-collector -f values.yaml install o2c openobserve/openobserve-collector</pre>

<h3><strong>Step 7: Import Prebuilt Dashboards</strong></h3>

<p>
OpenObserve provides a collection of prebuilt dashboards that cover common monitoring scenarios. You can easily import these dashboards into your OpenObserve instance. Check out the<a href="https://github.com/openobserve/dashboards"> OpenObserve Dashboards Repository</a> to explore the available dashboards and import the ones that suit your needs.
</p>
<ol>

<li>Download the json dashboard you want to use.

<li>In OpenObserve, click on the "Dashboards".

<li>Click on the "Import" button.

<li>Select the json file you downloaded.

<li>Click on the "Import" button.
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Step 8: Set Up Alerts and Notifications</strong></h3>

<p>
You can set up alert rules and notification channels to proactively monitor your system and be notified of anomalies or critical events. Refer to the<a href="https://openobserve.ai/docs/user-guide/alerts/alerts/"> OpenObserve Alerts Documentation</a> to learn how to define alert rules and configure notification channels.
</p>
<p>
OpenObserve supports the following kinds of alerts:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Standard alerts:</strong> Standard alerts are evaluated at a specified frequency (every 1 minute by default) for the condition of the alert, over the duration specified as part of the alert. If the condition evaluates to true, a notification is sent to the alert destination. Additionally, users can delay notifications after a notification is generated once for a specified time duration. For example, let's create a standard alert to notify us if the error code 500 occurs more than 15 times within a duration of 2 minutes, and we want this evaluation to happen every 1 minute:<br> 
<ol>
 
<li>In the OpenObserve web UI, navigate to the "Alerts" section.
 
<li>Click on "Create Alert" and select "Standard Alert."
 
<li>Set the alert name to "High Error 500 Occurrences."
 
<li>In the "Condition" field, enter: <code>error_code = 500</code>
 
<li>Set the "Threshold" to 15.
 
<li>Set the "Duration" to 2 minutes.
 
<li>Set the "Frequency" to 1 minute.
 
<li>Configure the desired notification channel (e.g., email, Slack).
 
<li>Click "Create" to save the alert.<br>
</li> 
</ol>

<li><strong>Real-time alerts:</strong> Real-time alerts are evaluated at ingestion time based on the specified condition. They are evaluated per record. For example, let's create a real-time alert to notify us when the API response time is more than 100 ms:<br> 
<ol>
 
<li>In the OpenObserve web UI, navigate to the "Alerts" section.
 
<li>Click on "Create Alert" and select "Real-time Alert."
 
<li>Set the alert name to "High API Response Time."
 
<li>In the "Condition" field, enter: <code>api_response_time > 100</code>
 
<li>Configure the desired notification channel (e.g., email, Slack).
 
<li>Click "Create" to save the alert.
</li> 
</ol>
</li> 
</ul>
<p>
With these examples, you can see how to create both standard and real-time alerts in OpenObserve. Standard alerts are useful for monitoring conditions over a specific duration and frequency, while real-time alerts are ideal for detecting and notifying about critical events as they occur in real-time.
</p>
<p>
Remember to customize the alert conditions, thresholds, and notification channels based on your specific requirements and monitoring needs.
</p>
<h3>Step 9: Define Dashboard Configuration</h2>

<p>
To create an observability dashboard, you must define its structure and content using a JSON configuration file. Here's an example of a simple dashboard configuration:
</p>
<p>

![Define Dashboard Configuration](/img/resources/observability-dashboards-image6.png "Define Dashboard Configuration")

</p>
<p>
The JSON metadata in the configuration file defines the dashboard's structure and behavior, specifying the widgets and charts and their arrangement. Data source definitions establish connections to Prometheus and OpenObserve, enabling the retrieval of relevant metrics and logs. The layout template, often based on frameworks like Grafana, provides the visual foundation for rendering the dashboard.
</p>
<h3><strong>Step 10: Connect Data Sources and Visualize</strong></h3>

<p>
With the dashboard configuration defined, you can now connect the data sources and visualize the data in your observability platform.
</p>
<p>
In Grafana, you can create a new dashboard and import the JSON configuration file. Grafana will automatically recognize the data sources specified in the configuration and retrieve the relevant data.
</p>
<h3><strong>Step 11: Set Up Alerts and Notifications</strong></h3>

<p>
You can set up alert rules and notification channels to proactively monitor your system and be notified of anomalies or critical events.
</p>
<p>
In Prometheus, you can define alert rules based on specific metrics and thresholds. Here's an example of an alert rule:<br><br>

![Set Up Alerts and Notifications](/img/resources/observability-dashboards-image8.png "Set Up Alerts and Notifications")

</p>
<p>
This rule triggers an alert named "HighCPUUsage" when the CPU usage on any instance exceeds 80% for 5 minutes. It sets the severity label to "warning" and includes a summary and description annotation.
</p>
<p>
You can configure Prometheus to send alerts to various notification channels, such as email, Slack, or PagerDuty, using the Alertmanager component.
</p>
<p>
Effective alert management ensures that you are promptly informed of any critical issues, allowing you to take timely action and maintain your system's health and performance.
</p>
<h3><strong>Step 12: Perform Regular Maintenance</strong></h3>

<p>
As your system evolves and monitoring requirements change, performing regular maintenance on your observability dashboards is crucial. This includes:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Modifying dashboard layouts to accommodate new metrics and visualizations

<li>Incorporating new data sources in the collector, such as databases or message queues, to enhance visibility

<li>Optimizing dashboard performance by fine-tuning queries and aggregations
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Regular maintenance ensures that your observability dashboards remain relevant, accurate, and efficient, providing the insights you need to manage your system effectively.
</p>
<h2><strong>Future Developments and Enhancements</strong></h2>

<p>
The future looks bright and full of exciting developments for observability dashboards. Let's peek into what's on the horizon:<br>
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>Ongoing work to support multiple custom dashboards from predefined templates</strong>: <br><br>While custom dashboards offer flexibility, creating them from scratch can be time-consuming. Wouldn't it be great if you could start with a predefined template and customize it to your needs?<br><br>Imagine having a library of carefully crafted dashboard templates that cover common monitoring scenarios, such as application performance, infrastructure health, and user behavior analytics. These templates will serve as a starting point, allowing you to quickly create custom dashboards by modifying and extending them to suit your specific requirements. <br>

<li><strong>Enhancing observability experience through user feedback and collaboration</strong>: Observability dashboards are not just about displaying data - they're about fostering collaboration and driving continuous improvement.
