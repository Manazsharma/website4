</p>
<h3>Introduction to Node.js Console Logger</h3>

<p>
The console module in Node.js offers several methods for logging messages to the console:
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>console.log()</strong>: Used for general logging of information.

<li><strong>console.info()</strong>: Similar to console.log(), typically used for informational messages.

<li><strong>console.warn()</strong>: Used for logging warning messages.

<li><strong>console.error()</strong>: Used for logging error messages.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
These methods are simple to use and provide a quick way to output messages to the console.
</p>
<h3>Differences and Use Cases for console.log(), console.info(), console.warn(), and console.error()</h3>

<p>
Each logging method serves a different purpose:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>console.log()</strong>: Used for general information and debugging messages.

<pre class="prettyprint">console.log("Server started on port 3000");</pre>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li><strong>console.info()</strong>: Used for informational messages, often similar to console.log().

<pre class="prettyprint">console.info("User logged in successfully");</pre>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li><strong>console.warn()</strong>: Used to indicate potential issues that are not critical.

<pre class="prettyprint">console.warn("Disk space is running low");</pre>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li><strong>console.error()</strong>: Used for error messages and exceptions.

<pre class="prettyprint">console.error("Failed to connect to the database", err);</pre>

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Limitations of Built-in Logging </h3>

<p>
While these built-in methods are handy, they come with limitations:
</p>
<ul>

<h2>Node.js Logging Best Practices</h2>

<p>
Adhering to best practices in logging ensures that your logs are useful, secure, and maintainable. Here are some essential guidelines to follow when implementing logging in your Node.js applications.
</p>
<h3>Avoid Using console.log() for Production Logs </h3>

<p>
While console.log() is useful for debugging during development, it is not suitable for production environments. It lacks features such as log levels, structured logging, and the ability to log to multiple destinations.
</p>
<h3>Implement Structured Logging </h3>

<p>
Structured logging involves formatting logs as structured data, typically in JSON format. This makes it easier to parse, search, and analyze logs.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">const winston = require('winston');

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.json(),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console(),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'app.log' })
  ]
});

logger.info({ message: 'User logged in', userId: 1234 });</pre>

<h3>Add Context to Your Logs </h3>

<p>
Including context in your logs helps in understanding the conditions under which an event occurred. This can include user IDs, request IDs, session IDs, and other relevant metadata.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">logger.info({ message: 'User updated profile', userId: 1234, changes: { email: 'new@example.com' } });</pre>

<h3>Avoid Logging Sensitive Information </h3>

<p>
Ensure that sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal identification numbers, is never logged. Mask or exclude sensitive data from your logs.
</p>
<h3>Automatically Log Uncaught Exceptions and Unhandled Promise Rejections </h3>

<p>
Capturing unhandled errors is crucial for diagnosing issues that cause your application to crash. Use process-level handlers to log these events.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
  logger.error('Uncaught Exception:', err);
});

process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
  logger.error('Unhandled Rejection:', reason);
});</pre>

<h3>Log Rotation and Retention Policies </h3>

<p>
Implement log rotation to prevent log files from growing indefinitely. Configure log retention policies to keep logs for a reasonable period.
</p>
<p>
const DailyRotateFile = require('winston-daily-rotate-file');
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.json(),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console(),
    new DailyRotateFile({
      filename: 'application-%DATE%.log',
      datePattern: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
      maxFiles: '14d'
    })
  ]
});</pre>

<p>
For more sophisticated logging needs, you can leverage advanced techniques to enhance your logging capabilities. These techniques provide greater control and flexibility, enabling you to capture detailed information and handle complex logging requirements.
</p>
<h3>Using the debug Module for Granular Logging Control </h3>

<p>
The debug module allows you to enable or disable logging dynamically based on environment variables. This is useful for controlling the verbosity of your logs without changing your code.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">const debug = require('debug')('app');

debug('This is a debug message');</pre>

<p>
To enable debug messages, set the DEBUG environment variable:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">DEBUG=app node yourapp.js</pre>

<h3>Understanding Log Levels </h3>

<p>
Implementing log levels helps categorize the severity of log messages. Common log levels include:
</p>
<ul>

<li>fatal: Critical errors causing application shutdown

<li>error: Runtime errors or unexpected conditions

<li>warn: Non-critical issues that could become problems

<li>info: General operational messages about application behavior

<li>debug: Detailed information for diagnosing issues

<li>trace: The most detailed level, including fine-grained information

<pre class="prettyprint">logger.log('error', 'This is an error message');
logger.log('warn', 'This is a warning message');
logger.log('info', 'This is an informational message');
logger.log('debug', 'This is a debug message');</pre>

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Implementing File Logging with the fs Module </h3>

<p>
For persistent logging, write log messages to a file using the fs module. This approach is useful for environments where external logging libraries are not an option.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">const fs = require('fs');

function logToFile(message) {
  fs.appendFile('application.log', `${new Date().toISOString()} - ${message}\n`, (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
  });
}

logToFile('Application started');</pre>

<h3>Extending Logger Functionality to Other JavaScript Files </h3>

<p>
Create a custom logger module and reuse it across different parts of your application. This promotes consistency and makes it easier to manage your logging configuration.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">// logger.js
const winston = require('winston');

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.json(),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console(),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'app.log' })
  ]
});

module.exports = logger;

// In other files
const logger = require('./logger');

logger.info('This is a log message from another file');</pre>
