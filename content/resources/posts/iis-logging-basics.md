IIS (Internet Information Services) logging is a server-side process that records detailed information about web requests handled by the server. This logging is essential for monitoring, troubleshooting, and analyzing the performance and security of your web applications.
</p>
<p>
IIS logs are typically stored in plain text files and follow a structured format. The most commonly used format is the W3C Extended Log File Format. Here's a breakdown of what you can expect in these logs:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Date and Time: When the request was processed.

<li>Client IP Address: The IP address of the client making the request.

<li>User Name: The authenticated user who accessed the resource, if applicable.

<li>Service Name and Instance: The site and instance number.

<li>Server IP Address and Port: The IP address and port of the server that handled the request.

<li>Request Method: The HTTP method used (GET, POST, etc.).

<li>URI Stem: The requested resource (e.g., a webpage or file).

<li>Protocol Status: The HTTP status code returned to the client.

<li>Bytes Sent and Received: The amount of data sent to and received from the client.

<li>User Agent: The client’s browser or application.
</li>
</ul>
