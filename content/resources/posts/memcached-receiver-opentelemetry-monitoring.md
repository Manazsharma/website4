<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Memcached is a popular caching system used to improve the performance of web applications by reducing the load on databases and other resources. OpenTelemetry is a set of APIs, SDKs, libraries, and integrations aiming to standardize the generation, collection, and management of telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces). This tutorial will explore how to use OpenTelemetry to monitor Memcached performance.
</p>
<h2>Memcached Architecture</h2>

<p>
Memcached is a distributed memory caching system that stores data in RAM. It is designed to be highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data. Memcached architecture consists of the following components:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Memcached Server: This is the core component of Memcached that stores and retrieves data.

<li>Memcached Client: This is the component that interacts with the Memcached server to store and retrieve data.

<li>Memcached Cluster: This is a group of Memcached servers that work together to store and retrieve data.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>OpenTelemetry Collector</h2>

<p>
OpenTelemetry Collector is a stand-alone service provided by OpenTelemetry. It can be used as a telemetry-processing system with a lot of flexible configurations to collect and manage telemetry data. The OpenTelemetry Collector can be used to collect metrics from Memcached and send them to a backend for visualization and analysis.
</p>
<h2>Configuring OpenTelemetry Collector for Memcached</h2>

<p>
To configure the OpenTelemetry Collector for Memcached, you need to specify the following settings:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Endpoint: The hostname/IP address and port or, unix socket file path of the Memcached instance.

<li>Collection Interval: This is the duration between runs of the receiver. The default value is 10 seconds.

<li>Initial Delay: This is the time the receiver waits before starting. The default value is 1 second.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here is an example configuration:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">yaml
receivers:
  memcached:
    endpoint: "localhost:11211"
    collection_interval: 10s
    initial_delay: 1s</pre>

<p>
Metrics and Attributes

<p>
The OpenTelemetry Collector can collect the following metrics and attributes from Memcached:

<h2>Understanding OpenTelemetry</h2>

<p>

![Understanding OpenTelemetry](/img/resources/memcached-receiver-image2.png "Understanding OpenTelemetry")

</p>
<h3><strong>OpenTelemetry in Modern Development</strong></h3>

<p>
OpenTelemetry aims to standardize the collection, processing, and export of telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces) from applications and infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>
The aim is to provide insights into their performance and behavior. It enables developers to understand the internal state of their systems through telemetry data.
</p>
<p>
OpenTelemetry is vendor-neutral, meaning it is not tied to any specific vendor or technology stack. This allows organizations to choose the best tools for their needs without being locked into a specific vendor.
</p>
<p>
It provides a unified approach to observability by offering consistent APIs and instrumentation libraries for multiple programming languages. 
</p>
<p>
This enables developers to track requests as they traverse through different services and components of distributed applications. 
</p>
<h3><strong>Community Support</strong></h3>

<p>
The vendor-neutrality fosters community-driven innovation and standardization in telemetry data collection practices. 
</p>
<p>
The community support for OpenTelemetry is vast, with independent developers and vendors actively contributing to the project, building solutions, and sharing knowledge freely, making it a collaborative and forward-thinking endeavor in observability.
</p>
<h2>The Role of OpenTelemetry in Memcached Monitoring</h2>

<p>
OpenTelemetry Collector is a component that collects telemetry data from Memcached instances and exports it to observability backends like OpenObserve. 
</p>
<p>
It provides a Memcached receiver that can fetch stats from a Memcached instance using the stats command.
</p>
<p>
The Memcached Collector Receiver supports collecting the following default metrics:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Memcached.bytes: Current number of bytes used to store items

<li>Memcached.commands: Number of commands of a specific type

<li>Memcached.connections: Number of connections

<li>Memcached.items: Number of items stored

<li>memcached.operations: Number of operations

<li>memcached.threads: Number of threads
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It also collects attributes like db.system, db.cluster.name, and deployment.environment.
</p>
<p>
To use the OpenTelemetry Collector for Memcached, you need to:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Install the OpenTelemetry Collector on the same host as the Memcached instance or ensure the Memcached port is accessible.

<li>Configure the Collector to use the Memcached receiver and specify the Memcached instance details.

<li>Export the collected data to an observability backend like OpenObserve for visualization and analysis.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Using the OpenTelemetry Collector, you can easily monitor Memcached performance, identify issues, and optimize your application's caching layer without needing custom instrumentation.

<li>Specify the Memcached server details in the receiver configuration.

<li>Configure the exporter to send the collected data to OpenObserve or another observability backend.
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Default Metrics and Attributes Collected by the Memcached Receiver</strong></h3>

<p>
The Memcached receiver collects default metrics such as <em>Memcached.bytes, memcached.commands, Memcached.connections, Memcached.items, Memcached.operations, and Memcached.threads</em>.
</p>
<p>
It also collects attributes like db.system, db.cluster.name, and deployment.environment.
</p>
<p>
The OpenTelemetry Collector will begin collecting metrics from the Memcached server and sending them to the configured observability backend.
</p>
<p>
By following these steps, you can set up the OpenTelemetry Collector to monitor your Memcached instances and gain insights into their performance and behavior using observability tools like OpenObserve.
