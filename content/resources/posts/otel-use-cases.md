<h2>Introduction to OpenTelemetry</h2>

<p>
OpenTelemetry is an open-source project that helps developers collect and send data about their applications to monitoring and observability platforms. 
</p>
<p>
It is a vendor-neutral initiative, which means it is not owned or controlled by any single company.
</p>
<h3><strong>Origin from the merger of OpenCensus and OpenTracing</strong></h3>

<p>
OpenTelemetry originated from the merger of two open-source projects: OpenCensus and OpenTracing. 
</p>
<p>
This merger took place in 2019. It combined the strengths of both projects to create a comprehensive and vendor-neutral solution for application monitoring and observability.
</p>
<p>
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) announced the merger of OpenCensus and OpenTracing into OpenTelemetry, a new project.
</p>
<h3><strong>Goals</strong></h3>

<p>
The merger combined the strengths of both projects, creating a unified solution for collecting and exporting telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) from applications.
</p>
<p>
By combining the expertise and resources of both projects, OpenTelemetry has become a robust and comprehensive solution for developers looking to gain visibility into their applications.
