<h2>Basics of Creating Search Queries</h2>

<p>

![Basics of Creating Search Queries](/img/resources/splunk-search-tutorial-image2.png "Basics of Creating Search Queries")

</p>
<p>
Getting started with Splunk search queries involves understanding some fundamental concepts and commands. These basics will form the foundation of your ability to extract valuable insights from your data.
</p>
<h4><strong>Step-by-Step Instruction on Starting with Simple Search Commands</strong></h4>

<ol>

<li>Starting a Search: Open the Search & Reporting app in Splunk. In the search bar, type your query. For instance, to search for all events in the past 24 hours, you can simply type index=_internal and hit enter.

<li>Refining Your Search: To narrow down your search results, add more specific criteria. For example, index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd will filter the results to only those from the splunkd sourcetype.

<li>Using Time Modifiers: Specify a time range to focus your search on a particular period. For instance, index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd earliest=-1h will show events from the last hour.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
To start, let's look at a basic search command. Assume you want to search for all events containing the word "error."
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">search error</pre>

<p>
This simple search will return all events that include the word "error" in their raw text.
</p>
<h4><strong>Understanding Boolean Operators for Refining Searches</strong></h4>

<p>
Boolean operators are essential for refining and combining search terms to get more precise results. The most commonly used operators in Splunk are:
</p>
<ul>

<li>AND: This operator ensures that all specified conditions are met. For example, index=_internal AND sourcetype=splunkd AND log_level=error will return only the events that meet all these criteria.

<li>OR: Use this operator to return results that match any of the specified conditions. For example, index=_internal AND (sourcetype=splunkd OR sourcetype=access_combined) will return events from either splunkd or access_combined sourcetypes.

<li>NOT: This operator excludes certain results. For example, index=_internal AND sourcetype=splunkd NOT log_level=info will return all events from the splunkd sourcetype except those with a log level of info.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here are some examples: 
</p>

1. AND Operator: Use AND to ensure that both terms appear in the search results. For example, to find events that contain both "error" and "timeout":

<pre class="prettyprint">search error AND timeout</pre>

</li>
</ol>
<p>

2. OR Operator: Use OR to find events that contain either term. For example, to find events with either "error" or "fail":

<pre class="prettyprint">search error OR fail</pre>

<p>

3. NOT Operator: Use NOT to exclude certain terms. For example, to find events with "error" but not "timeout":

<pre class="prettyprint">search error NOT timeout</pre>

<h4><strong>Techniques for Combining Keywords and Boolean Logic to Filter Results</strong></h4>

<p>
Combining keywords and Boolean logic allows you to create complex search queries that precisely filter your data:
</p>
<ol>

<li>Nested Searches: Use parentheses to group conditions and control the order of operations. For example, index=_internal AND (sourcetype=splunkd AND log_level=error) OR (sourcetype=access_combined AND status=404) will return splunkd errors or access_combined 404 status events.

<li>Field Comparisons: Use comparison operators to filter based on field values. For instance, index=_internal AND bytes>1000 will return events where the bytes field value is greater than 1000.

<li>Wildcards: Employ wildcards to match partial strings. For example, index=_internal AND host=\\\*server\\\* will return events where the host field contains the word “server.”
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Here are a few examples:
</p>

1. Combining Keywords and Boolean Operators: To find events related to login failures that are either "error" or "fail" but not "timeout":

<pre class="prettyprint">search login (error OR fail) NOT timeout</pre>

</li>
</ol>
<p>

2. Using Wildcards: Wildcards can be used to match partial words. For example, to find events with terms starting with "err":

<pre class="prettyprint">search err*</pre>

<p>

3. Field-Specific Searches: You can search within specific fields to narrow down results. For example, to find events where the status field is "404":

<pre class="prettyprint">search status=404</pre>

<p>

4. Time-Based Searches: To filter events within a specific time range, you can use the earliest and latest keywords. For example, to find errors in the last 24 hours:

<pre class="prettyprint">search error earliest=-24h</pre>

5. Using Subsearches: Subsearches allow you to perform a search within another search. For example, to find events related to user logins and then search for errors within those events:

<pre class="prettyprint">search [ search login ] error</pre>

<p>
These examples provide a foundation for creating more sophisticated search queries. By combining these techniques, you can tailor your searches to find exactly the information you need.
</p>
