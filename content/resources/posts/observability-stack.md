<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>





<p>

What if you could predict and solve issues in your system before it even impacts the user experience, guaranteeing a flawless experience every single time. Pretty cool, huh? ‘<a href="https://openobserve.ai/blog/observability-platforms">Observability stack</a>’ is not just a buzzword, companies all around the world are leveraging a strong observability stack for their systems. But, what is observability in the first place and what are the practices and tools you need to implement it? Intrigued? Let’s talk about observability and how it can be your solution to not just monitor but actively maintain your systems and infrastructure for an ultimate user satisfaction and unparalleled system performance.

</p>

<p>

Before we dive into the details, let's first get clear on what Observability actually means.

</p>

<h2><strong>What is Observability?</strong></h2>





<p>

In simple terms, Observability gives you a window seat to everything in your system. You measure the internal state of your system by analyzing its outputs. With traditional monitoring processes, you can be notified when something is wrong, such as an outage or a performance issue, but with Observability, you get a broader approach, which includes telemetry data gathering and advanced analytics. 

</p>

<p>

Now, Observability utilizes three types of telemetry data;

</p>

<p>

![what is observability](/img/resources/what-is-observability.jpg)

</p>

<ul>

<li>Logs are immutable records that provide a timestamped history of all events or transactions. They are invaluable for debugging and security purposes.



<li>Metrics are quantifiable data points that measure the long-term state of systems and applications. They provide snapshots of performance and health, CPU usage, and response times.



<li>Traces are records that track the journey of a request that has been submitted through various services and components. They offer information about the entire lifecycle of your request.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Here's a flow of how the trio works together to provide system insights regarding performance and health:

</p>

<ul>



<li>Metrics can notify teams regarding a spike in server load.



<li>Logs help provide a detailed summary needed to identify the cause.



<li>Traces give you an idea of how the issue affects user experience across the system.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Together, these pillars are way faster in responding to and analyzing the root causes of problems.

</p>

<h3><strong>The role of telemetry data in achieving effective Observability</strong></h3>





<p>

Telemetry is crucial as it provides the raw material needed to gauge the states of your systems and applications in order to achieve effective Observability.  It simply collects, aggregates, and analyzes system data so that organizations can go from a reactive approach to a proactive management approach to their IT environment. You get real-time monitoring and notifications that can help teams detect anomalies beforehand. 'A goodbye to full-blown issue escalations and hello to reliable and efficient operational systems'

<h3><strong>The importance of OpenTelemetry in standardizing observability practices</strong></h3>





<p>

OpenTelemetry is a set of APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation that standardizes the creation and collection of telemetry data across cloud-native applications. As an open-source project, it can bring about interoperability and offer a vendor-neutral way to collect logs, metrics, and traces. 

</p>

<p>

When you adopt <a href="https://openobserve.ai/blog/tag/opentelemetry">OpenTelemetry</a>, you can enjoy seamless integration with different tools and platforms, ensuring consistent observability practices across the systems development and production. This standardization is essential for organizations as it can reduce the complexity and cost associated with maintaining custom instrumentation and ensures effective communication throughout all parts of the observability stack.

</p>

<h2><strong>Data Collection and Instrumentation</strong></h2>





<p>

Alright, with the standards in place, let's move on to the nuts and bolts of data collection and instrumentation. Collecting telemetry data is an important step when you want to build a comprehensive and effective observability stack. The techniques to go about it may vary, but generally, it involves gathering logs, metrics and traces from across your systems. 

</p>

<p>

As mentioned, logs provide a record of events, metrics give you numerical data points over time, and traces take you through the journey of requests taken through your applications. For this comprehensive data collection, it is essential to integrate telemetry at every layer of your infrastructure and application stack. With this, teams can monitor and troubleshoot systems effectively.

</p>

<h3><strong>Instrumentation strategies for applications and infrastructure</strong></h3>





<p>

Instrumentation strategies gather data insights from applications and infrastructures by embedding monitoring and tracking codes in your applications. Which might involve capturing response times, error rates, or application system calls.

</p>

<p>

It might also mean monitoring system performance indicators like memory consumption rate, network latency, or CPU usage for infrastructure. These strategies can either be built into the application or infrastructure from the outset or added later on. With effective instrumentation strategies, you are blessed with raw data that can be utilized to underpin robust Observability.

</p>

<h3><strong>Auto-instrumentation vs. manual instrumentation</strong></h3>





<p>

Choosing between auto and manual instrumentation depends on the specific needs and capacities of your operations and development teams.
